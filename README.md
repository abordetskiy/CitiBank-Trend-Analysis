##### Data Extraction

Data was extracted directly from CitiBike's website (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) via the CitiBike_scraper.py script. To keep headers consistent, files prior to 2017 were removed and the windows terminal copy command was used to merge the files to one central .csv. 
Tableau public should have the data extracted and uploaded, but in the event that an error occurs, please replicate this process to connect to the finalized dataset. The exact termnal command used is: {copy *.csv CitiBank_data_JC.csv}
